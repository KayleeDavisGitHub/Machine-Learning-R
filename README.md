# Machine-Learning
Replication and notes on machine learning practice.

Here the Lab 4 files go over generating synthetic data and using penalized regression models for classification. Lab 4 ends with cleaning text data, and various ways to go about this.

Lab 5 goes into using Support Vector Models (SVMs) and classification trees for classification. Lab 5 uses synthetic data.

Both labs provide vizualizations and attempts to summarize a dense methodological approach by providing .pdf's (and LaTeX code) detailing the intution behind these approaches.
